    """
    The "ImageList" class is to handle batches of images that may be of varying sizes, so model can process images uniformly.

    This class is a slightly modified implementation of the PyTorch implementation.
    (https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/detection/image_list.py)

    The original class requres image_sized 2 args:
    tensors (tensor): Tensor containing images.
    image_sizes (list[tuple[int, int]]): List of Tuples each containing size of images.
    
    We simplifies the initialization by not requiring the explicit list of image sizes. The MIMIC-CXR image dataset we use has a uniform size(256Ã—256).
